# About the project

In this project I created a shop for a fake ropeway. The projest was made in HTML, CSS, JS and React.
The design of app is responsive (usage of flexbox and grid). In componnets I used: useState, useEffect, useNavigate hooks. I also used session storage for keeping order data in a cart and in a order summary.
